A Dart wrapper for the browser's WebRTC API, making real-time communication accessible and idiomatic for Dart and Flutter web developers.

## <span style="font-size:1.5em;">What is dart-webrtc?</span>

**dart-webrtc** leverages the [dart/js](https://pub.dev/packages/js) library to re-wrap the [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) JavaScript interface, providing seamless integration with all major browsers. This project is the foundation for WebRTC support in [flutter-webrtc](https://github.com/flutter-webrtc/flutter-webrtc) and enables peer-to-peer audio, video, and data channels directly from Dart or Flutter web apps.
